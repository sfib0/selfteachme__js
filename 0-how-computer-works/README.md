### Computers
#### Why we use Computers
Before talking about programming languages, we first have to know why we use Computers? 
Computers have become a part of our daily lives.
We do many tasks from Computer.
Computers are used for communication purposes, store and calculate data

#### Reasons to use Computers
- Efficiency
  - Time: Computers do tasks in seconds.
  - Labour: No labour work is needed.
  - Resources: It save resources. from electricity to production of materials.
- Accuracy
  - Computers do same tasks repeatedly with 100% accuracy
- Reliabilility
  - Computers can be relied because they do tasks accurately without tiring or getting bored.
- Communication
  - Via Computers, communication with anyone is possible regardless of time or distance.
  - You can share any file, use same desktop and even work with shared documents.
  - You can make calls, chat with friends, send emails, send photos and share interests.

### Software
#### Why develop Software Applications?
- To make Computers work, we make programs on computers which are called software.
- Every software do solve our real world problems or fill our needs.
- We automate our real world situations to software applications so that they can be done more effeciently, reliability and accurately.

#### Real World Problem - Software Solution
- Emails: Now, we can send emails with clicks from online email services like Gmail and Outlook rather than using postbox.
- Data: Now, we can store our data with clicks by software tools like Excel or any database or Drive applications rather than mainting journals or books.
- Networking: Now, we can chat with friends and much more from online website and apps rather than going to their houses everyday.
- Entertainment: We can listen to music, watch movies or any TV series.
- Education: We can find books to read. We can search for any information.

### Programming Language
#### How do we communicate Computers?
- Computers can understand the language of 0's and 1's (binary).
- Computers cannot understand our plain English.
- This communication can be eliminate by programming languages.
- You are not going to use binary to tell the computer what to do.
- Programming Language is like a bridge between humans and computers.
- Programming Language is a set of instructions that commands computer to work according to it.

#### Types of Programming Languages
They are of two types.
- Low-level Languages
- High-level Languages

| Low-level Languages                                                          | High-level Languages                                          |
| :--------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Understood by Machines                                                       | Understood by programmers                                     |
| Close 0's and 1's.                                                           | Includes human languages keywords.                            |
| Machine Dependent (Machine code runs according to its hardware architecture) | Machine Independent (It can run on any hardware architecture) |
| Executes quickly                                                             | Executes slowly because it requires translator program.       |
| Difficult to write, debug, modify and understand.                            | Easy to write, debug, read, modify and understand             |
| It's called machine code.                                                    | It's called source code.                                      |
| Assembly Language, Binary Language                                           | C++, Python, JavaScript. etc.                                 |
