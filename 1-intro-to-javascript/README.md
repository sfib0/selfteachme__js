## Vision of Marc Andreessen
- Only static pages were available on the internet.
- There was no dynamic content.
- The vision of Marc Andreessen (Netscape Founder) is to make browser more interactive by adding dynamic content support, animation support and by adding many forms of small automations.
- Web needed a small scripting language that would interact with the DOM (Document Object Model).

## Brendan Eich
- JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 at Netscape Communications. It was inspired by Java, Scheme, and Self.
- He was recruited by Marc Andreessen in 1995 for creating JavaScript.
- A very short deadline was given to him.
- He was tasked to develop a "Scheme for the browser".
- Netscape collaboratted with Sun Microsystems to include Sun's programming language Java to compete with Microsoft to make adoption of web technologies and platform easier for users.
- It was decided that JavaScript should be as understandable as HTML and should complement with Java language and should have similar syntax like Java.
- The company needed a prototype to defend the idea of JavaScript.
- Eich wrote one in 10 days in May 1995.
- He had the advantages of adding any feature but he had to work fast. 

### Mocha LiveScript JavaScript
- JavaScipt's first prototype was named as Mocha.
- When it was tagged as function, it got integrated into Netscape Communicator.
- It was renamed to LiveScript when the first beta release of Netscape Navigation 2.0 was launched.
- The deal between Netscape and Sun Microsystems was closed in 1995.
  - Mocha/LiveScript would be renamed to JavaScript
  - It would be for small client-side tasks in the browser.
  - While Java would be promoted as a bigger, profession tool to develop richer web components.
- It was named to JavaScript to take advantage of Java's name for new Web Programming Language.
- From the beginning, JavaScript influences in competing browser by making it possible to make better UX/UI implementations with it.
