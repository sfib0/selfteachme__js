# Comments
  Comments are that can be write but will not
  be executed.

Ex:
```js
// Database connection string is in the local.settings.json file.
// TODO: Add a connection string to the local.settings.json file.
/* 
  console.log("Nobody will see this because it is a comment.");
*/ 
```

## Single line comments
- Starts with //
- Only applies to one line.

## Multi-line comments
- Can be used to comment out multiple lines.
- Starts with /* and ends with */

### When you should comment?
- Its better to make your code clean rather than making comments that are not needed. (i.e. self-document your code).
- To many comments make your code dirty
- Write code in a way that it self-explain what it will do.
