## Vision of Marc Andreessen
- Only static pages were available on the internet.
- There was no dynamic content.
- The vision of Marc Andreessen (Netscape Founder) is to make browser more interactive by adding dynamic content support, animation support and by adding many forms of small automations.
- Web needed a small scripting language that would interact with the DOM (Document Object Model).

## Brendan Eich
- JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 at Netscape Communications. It was inspired by Java, Scheme, and Self.
- He was recruited by Marc Andreessen in 1995 for creating JavaScript.
- A very short deadline was given to him.
- He was tasked to develop a "Scheme for the browser".
- Netscape collaboratted with Sun Microsystems to include Sun's programming language Java to compete with Microsoft to make adoption of web technologies and platform easier for users.
- It was decided that JavaScript should be as understandable as HTML and should complement with Java language and should have similar syntax like Java.
- The company needed a prototype to defend the idea of JavaScript.
- Eich wrote one in 10 days in May 1995.
- He had the advantages of adding any feature but he had to work fast. 

### Mocha LiveScript JavaScript
- JavaScipt's first prototype was named as Mocha.
- When it was tagged as function, it got integrated into Netscape Communicator.
- It was renamed to LiveScript when the first beta release of Netscape Navigation 2.0 was launched.
- The deal between Netscape and Sun Microsystems was closed in 1995.
  - Mocha/LiveScript would be renamed to JavaScript
  - It would be for small client-side tasks in the browser.
  - While Java would be promoted as a bigger, profession tool to develop richer web components.
- It was named to JavaScript to take advantage of Java's name for new Web Programming Language.
- From the beginning, JavaScript influences in competing browser by making it possible to make better UX/UI implementations with it.

## JScript from Microsoft
- Microsoft was compelled to reverse-engineer JavaScript support into Internet Explorer as JScript in 1996.
- There was implementation difference between JScript from that found in Netscape Navigator.
- The same features created for both browser were not compatible on both browsers.
- Double work was required by programmers to make a single website work on both browsers because of difference in implementations between the two languages.
- Website started being tagged as "best viewed in Internet Explorer", "best viewed in Netscape".

## ECMAScript
It was realized by Netscape that for an interactive, dynamic web to succedd, JavaScript have to be consistent across browsers.
In November 1996, JavaScript was submitted by Netscape to ECMA International to carva out a standard specification which other browsers vendors could then implement based on the work done at Netscape.
At first, JavaScript was given ECMA-262 identification number for standard.
It was decided to create standard specifications to be followed by all web browsers.
JavaScript was then opened to wider audience making its evolution better by giving it the voice of other potential implementers.
